Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, images, and code, by learning patterns from existing data. It uses deep learning models and algorithms to generate novel outputs that are statistically similar to the data it was trained on, often in response to user prompts. Examples include creating art from a text description or generating human-like text for a chatbot
